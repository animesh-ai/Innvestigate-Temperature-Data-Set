# Innvestigate-Temperature-Data-Set
Investigation of Worlds Average Temperature and A City(May be near by you) Average Temperature over last 200 years.

Initial Steps:

Data was extracted using SQL from Udacity Resources Column. The data was downloaded in form of CSV file. 
Data can be analysed using Google Spreadsheet. If you analyse using python or R, you are most welcome.

Prerequisites:

1) Google Spreadsheet (If you analyse using spreadsheet.)
2) Python installation and its libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn


Process:

I found the mean average temperature in my city and also the mean average temprature of World over the last 200 years.
Compared both the temperature using line graph. Visual insights were noted down and presented in a pdf format.


Conslusion:

I did the analysis for finding insights. If you wish to apply statistical tests, then you are most welcome. 
The main pupose of the project is to document the interesting insight about the both the temperature over the years.
